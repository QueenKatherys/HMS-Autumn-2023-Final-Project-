# HMS-Autumn-2023-Final-Project-

Subject: Proposal for Final Project - Data Wrangling and Modeling in R; A Simple Linear Regression Lesson for Researchers. 

To Whom it May Concern

I am writing to propose my final project for HMS 520.  I will be working individually on this project, and my primary goal is to analyze a sample data set from a physician, 'Patient_List_aaliyah-washington-md.csv'  using data wrangling and modeling tools in R.

NOTE: PLEASE IMPORT THE CSV FILE 'Patient_List_aaliyah-washington-md.csv' WITHIN THIS REPOSITORY BEFORE BEGINNING THIS EXCERCISE FOR THIS PROJECT !!!!!!!! 

This particular project provides a beginner's guide to simple linear regression, using a provided data set from a physician. 
Simple linear regression is a machine learning technique which can be used and demonstrated in R. 
As a second year master's level student working on their thesis in machine learning applied to biomedical systems, I designed this project for learners at all levels, from novices to advanced users, with the intention to cater to both students and researchers seeking to enhance their R skills. 

NOTE: PLEASE IMPORT THE CSV FILE 'Patient_List_aaliyah-washington-md.csv' BEFORE BEGINNING THIS EXCERCISE!!!!!!!! 

I had a lot of fun working on this simple, yet comprehensive demonstration of a this simple machine learning model. 

Team Member(s): Myself, Kathleen Ashbaker

Project Format: The project will be presented in a written report format along with R code and visualizations to demonstrate the data wrangling and modeling processes. Additionally, I will provide a presentation summarizing the key findings and insights from the project.

Overall Goal: The overall goal of this project is to apply the concepts and skills I have learned throughout this course to a real-world dataset. Specifically, I intend to:

Data Wrangling: Clean, preprocess, and transform the dataset to make it suitable for analysis. This will involve tasks such as handling missing data, data normalization, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough EDA to understand the dataset's characteristics, including summary statistics, data distributions, and identifying potential patterns or trends.

Modeling: Apply appropriate statistical and machine learning models to gain insights or make predictions based on the dataset. The choice of models will depend on the nature of the dataset and the research questions.


Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models and interpret the results. This step will include metrics, visualizations, and any necessary hypothesis testing.




Detailed Plans and Timeline:

By December 2-4: I will finalize the selection of the dataset for analysis. The dataset will be chosen based on its relevance and complexity to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of data wrangling and modeling techniques.

By December 5: I will complete the initial data exploration and cleaning phase. This includes handling missing values, addressing outliers, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

By December 5: I will conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and identify any preliminary patterns or relationships.

By December 7: I will start building and training statistical or machine learning models based on the research questions or objectives of the analysis.

By December 10: I will evaluate the models' performance, fine-tune them if necessary, and generate visualizations and summary statistics to present the results.

By December 13: I will complete the final report, including the project's introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. Additionally, I will prepare the presentation slides.

By December 14: I will rehearse and refine my presentation for the project's submission.

By December 15: I will submit the final project report and deliver the presentation during the designated presentation period.

I believe that this project will provide a valuable opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills gained during the course to real-world data analysis. I am committed to completing the project successfully and look forward to your guidance and feedback throughout the process.

Thank you for considering my proposal, and I am excited to embark on this project.

Sincerely,

Kathleen Ashbaker
